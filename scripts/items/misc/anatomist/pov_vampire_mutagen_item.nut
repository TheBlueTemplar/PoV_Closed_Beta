Under the cover of darkness, they transform into a relentless predator, their strength, speed, and reflexes sharpened by the shadows. Injuries become fleeting as the bearer draws vitality from the blood of their enemies, healing themselves with every strike against those who bleed. The night no longer holds any mysteries or hindrances, becoming their ultimate domain.\n\nHowever, this power is a double-edged sword. The bright light of day weakens them, dulling their senses and sapping their combat prowess, as if the sun itself conspired to drain their vitality. A gift of dark potency, this mutagen is ideal for those who thrive in the obscurity of night, but its curse ensures they must tread carefully under the unforgiving gaze of daylight.";
