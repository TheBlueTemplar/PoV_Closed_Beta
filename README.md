# Path-of-the-Vatt-ghern-V0.2.5-Beta
**Changelog in the Release Notes**

### There are two main "objectives" about this test:

Try making a Vatt'ghern with any origin other than my mod's, then take note of your experience of the entire process. Was it fun, was it balanced?

Play around with the Vatt'ghern (regardless of ho you obtained him). Does this feel broken op? does it feel 'earned'. Does it "fit" in the base game and Legends?

Also play around with the new events, and overall mechanics, including the Enemy Mutation System, do you like it? Is it balanced? Please do tell me!


### Installation:

Download the zip and place into your bb data folder (Do not extract)
